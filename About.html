            <br>

        Welcome to GremlingCove™, your premier (and only) destination for adopting magical, mildly chaotic companions! Founded entirely by accident during a thunderstorm and a misplaced shipment of enchanted furballs, we’ve grown into the world’s leading supplier of ethically-sourced, questionably-behaved Gremlins.
        <br>

        At GremlingCove™, we believe every home deserves a dash of mystery, a sprinkle of glitter, and a small creature that may or may not rearrange your furniture while you sleep. Our team of wranglers, whisperers, and part-time wizard interns ensure each Gremlin is semi-trained, semi-domesticated, and fully ready to cause delightful mayhem in your life.
        <br>

        We’re not just a pet store. We’re a lifestyle. A community. A legally ambiguous organization with a firm policy against interdimensional fraud.
        <br>

        Join us, and let the mischief begin.
        <br>

        GremlingCove™ — Adopt Chaos Responsibly.
