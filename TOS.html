        Terms of Service for GremlingCove™
<br>
        Welcome to GremlingCove™. By visiting, purchasing, or interacting with our services, you agree to the following terms and conditions, which may or may not include the sacrifice of an apple to the Gremling gods (you’ll know when it’s required).
        <br>
        1. Ownership of Gremlins:
        Upon adopting a Gremlin from GremlingCove™, you are granted a lifetime lease on your Gremlin. Full ownership is only transferred after your Gremlin successfully wins a game of chess against an elder Gremlin. The game may take several weeks, so be patient.
        <br>
        2. Feeding Your Gremlin:
        Gremlins are only fed on Tuesdays and Thursdays between the hours of 2:00 PM and 2:03 PM. We highly recommend you do not attempt to feed them at any other time. Gremlins may choose to reject food and give you cryptic riddles as a form of protest.
        <br>
        3. Emotional Support Gremlins:
        While Gremlins are capable of providing emotional support, their methods may include, but are not limited to, mimicking your voice in a high-pitched tone, whispering strange prophecies. You acknowledge that these actions are part of the Gremlin's nature and will not hold GremlingCove™ liable for any minor inconveniences such as vivid nightmares.
        <br>
        5. Gremlin Security Features:
        By entering GremlingCove™, you agree to allow Gremlins to assess your personal security system. This may involve unlocking all your doors, rearranging your furniture, and possibly, making cryptic demands. We do not apologize for this behavior.
        <br>
        6. Final Disclaimer:
        By accepting these terms, you acknowledge that GremlingCove™ does not offer refunds under any circumstances. Once a Gremlin has been adopted, it is your responsibility to maintain its happiness. Any attempt to return a Gremlin due to “unexpected behavior” will result in a permanent ban from GremlingCove™ and a visit from our “Gremlin Relations” department, which may involve a peculiar amount of paperwork and a mandatory clown costume.
        
        Thank you for adopting a Gremlin and supporting GremlingCove™. We are not responsible for any minor, medium, or large-scale apocalypses caused by your Gremlin. Enjoy your adventure into the weird, the wild, and the wonderfully chaotic!
