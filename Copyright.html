    GremlingCove™ Copyright Notice
    <br>

© 2025 GremlingCove™. All rights reserved.
<br>

By visiting GremlingCove™, purchasing Gremlins, or engaging in any activities involving our delightful, sometimes unpredictable creatures, you hereby agree to the following terms regarding intellectual property and the unauthorized use of our copyrighted content:
<br>
1. GremlingCove™ Trademark & Branding:
The term "GremlingCove™" and all associated logos, designs, and slogans (including but not limited to "Adopt a Gremlin, Live a Mystery" and "Cursed Pets, Cursed Prices") are trademarks of GremlingCove™. You may not use, copy, or alter these trademarks for commercial purposes without written consent from our Gremlin overseers, who may or may not be available for meetings after 2 AM.
<br>
2. Gremling™ Intellectual Property:
The Gremlins you adopt are the intellectual property of GremlingCove™, but we allow limited ownership rights, as specified in the "Adoption and Lease Agreement" section of your contract. While you may enjoy your Gremlin's company, you may not use their likeness, sounds, or general aura for any commercial production without obtaining our very peculiar, time-sensitive permission (it may involve signing with invisible ink, so be prepared).
<br>
3. User-Generated Content:
Any and all content you generate involving your Gremlins, including but not limited to videos, memes, fan art, or social media posts, is considered "user-generated content." GremlingCove™ reserves the right to use, modify, and sell such content, even if your Gremlin is featured in a compromising situation (such as looking particularly confused during a magical transformation). By posting this content publicly, you give GremlingCove™ perpetual, irrevocable rights to use, distribute, and remix said content.
<br>
4. The GremlingCove™ Songbook:
Any songs composed by Gremlins during the course of their existence remain the exclusive property of GremlingCove™. If your Gremlin creates a song that is somehow recognizable as a tune, even if it’s just a series of barks or random clattering noises, you must report it to GremlingCove™ immediately. We reserve the right to release it as an experimental album.
<br>
5. Copyright Infringement Policy:
If you believe that GremlingCove™ has infringed upon your intellectual property, please refrain from sending us any letters made from shredded newspaper or glitter bombs. Instead, send us a simple, polite letter with your complaint, and one of our Gremlin lawyers will respond promptly (within 4-6 business weeks, unless interrupted by an unscheduled portal opening).
<br>
6. Gremlin-generated Artwork:
Gremlins, at their discretion, may occasionally produce "artworks" (which may resemble blobs, spirals, or the occasional abstract portrait of you while you sleep). You acknowledge that these artworks belong to GremlingCove™, and any attempt to reproduce or sell these creations is forbidden without our prior approval, which may involve an unreasonably long meeting with a Gremlin art critic.
<br>
7. Gremlin-Specific Content Creation:
If you create any media (film, television, or digital content) involving Gremlins, you must agree to our "Gremlin Script Review" process, which includes but is not limited to: receiving feedback on the script from a council of four Gremlins, providing them snacks, and signing a declaration stating that you will not make any Gremlin character appear too competent, sane, or capable of passing a high school math test.
<br>
8. The Gremlin Prophecy Clause:
Any reference to a Gremlin prophecy that involves future events is purely fictional and owned by GremlingCove™. Should a Gremlin prophecy ever come true, the copyright of that prophecy is reserved by us. The Gremlin responsible for the prophecy may also receive a 10% royalty payment for each prediction fulfilled, payable in glitter or socks (whichever is more convenient).
<br>
By continuing to interact with GremlingCove™, you agree to respect these creative, quirky, and occasionally surreal terms. Remember, GremlingCove™ is the exclusive owner of all Gremlin intellectual property and will not hesitate to send our most mischievous Gremlins to perform unspeakable tasks (like hiding your car keys or rearranging your bookshelf) if necessary to protect our rights.
<br>
Thank you for choosing GremlingCove™—where the copyrights are as mysterious as the creatures!
